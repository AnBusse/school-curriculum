# Front-End Foxes School Curriculum

Sourced primarily from [Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft](https://youtube.com/watch?v=R1wrdtmBSII) who created [Web Dev for Beginners](https://aka.ms/webdev-beginners), we are pleased to offer an 11-week, 22-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics, with a sprinkling of React.js at the end. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

> **Students**, this is the curriculum that is taught at Front-End Foxes School, a bootcamp for women with worldwide cohorts. Here are things to get set up before the cohort starts:
> - Create a free [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account. This is where you will store your code.
> - Install .git on you local computer. [Here are instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on how to do this. 
> - Get used to the command line. This is your Terminal on Mac, and your Command Prompt on Windows. Learn more in [this article](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line).
> - Download and install the free code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a typing game, a virtual terrarium, a 'green' browser extension,  a business-type banking app, a pet adoption app with Vue.js and a React.js portfolio to host all your work. The student will have learned basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, a bit of Vue.js and React.js frameworks, along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer. 

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with video from the "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript?WT.mc_id=academic-13441-cxa)" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 11 week cycle.
